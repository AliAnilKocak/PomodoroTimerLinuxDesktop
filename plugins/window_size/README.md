# window_size

This plugin allows resizing and repositioning the window containing the Flutter
content, as well as querying screen information.

This is a prototype, and in the long term will likely be replaced by functionality
within the Flutter framework itself. The API will likely change significantly.

**Note**: Further related functionality, such as window minimization and maximization,
will likely be added to this plugin in the future. PRs are welcome to add functionality
of that kind to any or all platforms.

## Supported Platforms

- [x] macOS
- [x] Windows
- [x] Linux

Not all operations have been implemented on all platforms, but the core functionality
of resizing and repositioning is available for all three.

## Use

See [the plugin README](../README.md) for general instructions on using FDE plugins.
